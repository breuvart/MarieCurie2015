\section{Summary}

Software is becoming increasingly complex and critical (autonomous vehicles, the internet of things, financial systems, etc.). Bugs, security vulnerabilities, or inefficient resource management are costly. Type systems are a scalable way to analyze software but is hindered by a certain lack of expressiveness. ``Graded type systems'' can improve the state-of-the-art by including more information in the types and by incorporating some inspiration from abstract interpretation, another static analysis method which is extremely expressive, but as opposed to types lacks compositionality. Compositionality is important because it gives great support for scalability.

Functional programming languages often use complex type systems describing the behavior of the programs. These types are statically inferred before the compilation, acting as a first test for the correctness of the program. The advantage of type systems is their inherent compositionality. This means that libraries come with pre-computed types which are easily checkable. However, the verification power is low, restricted to the fact that composition of programs never fails due to incompatibility of format.

More refined static, whole-program analysis can generally be performed by abstract interpretation (AI). Those techniques are very efficient but fail to compose. This means that any new analysis has to be performed through the whole program, including libraries. Such a global analysis has two flaws: it is often too resource consuming to be used on a regular basis, and the behaviours of common libraries are approximated while it could be interesting to manually optimize their interpretation once and for all.

In parallel, several functional languages such as Coq, Agda, F* or Idris offer to associate to programs certain proofs of correctness encoded in a dependent type system. These dependant type systems are extremely expressive: not only can they catch up to any abstract interpretation analyses but they can describe many more refined behaviours. Moreover, these systems are still compositional and can produce certificates. However, the automatic inference is hardly ever automatisable, so the programer has to produce the proofs mostly manually, even though the system can provide some help.

Notice, also, that performing statical analysis under richly typed languages should be advantageous:  advanced type systems offer several ways to encode semantical information inside the type (for readability or for safety). However, actual tools are basically forgetting the type of a program before running the analysis, losing all this semantical information given by the programmer.
%outdated: allowing dependant type is actually biased: dependant proofs are formally expliciting important invariants of the program that should be of use for automatically check any other properties. Without going that far, advanced type systems offer several ways to encode semantical information inside the type (for readability or for safety). However, actual tools are basically forgetting the type of a program before running the analysis, loosing all this semantical information given by the programmer.

In this project, we propose to investigate a way to recover as much information as possible from type inference which is one of the most complex kinds of compositional and static analysis. The ideal outcome would be a static analyser for functional languages that can compete with existing ones while being completely compositional.

%drg: Are you sure? Global analysis and optimisation will always outperform compositional analysis. This is a mathematical unavoidable fact which has to do with the non-composability of Kan extensions. 
%F: Sure, I do not delud myself on this point (even if I did not know the Kan-extention argument). But I belive that some classes of properties and with good notions of dependancy, type systems will not fall so far behind. 

For this purpose, we are focusing on emerging parameterised type systems. The parameters represent either qualitative statements or quantitative information over resources. Such type systems will be called \em{graded types systems}.

A good point of comparison would be Hoare triples with preconditions and postconditions that need to match during composition, but some differences must be emphasised:
\begin{itemize}
\item A program is not only associated with a precondition and a postcondition corresponding to the parametrisation of the input and output types, but also with {\bf higher order conditions} parameterising every subtype (especially arrow types).
\item All of these conditions are dependent over ``resource variables'' that are instantiated by unification during the composition (adding some new constraints). In particular, this allows any program to have a {\bf most general type} that characterises it; this most general type is computed once and can be reused each time the program is used in a larger project.
\item Constraints are not logical propositions but element of an {\bf algebraic structure}. These structures take shape of ordered monoids or ordered semirings. They are reminiscent of abstract interpretation domains.
\end{itemize}

The SATIR project has three objectives. The {\bf first} (and main) {\bf objective} is to develop the theory of graded type systems in order to be as expressive as possible, to adapt to existing functional languages and to recover AI's constructions (Galois relations and widening). The {\bf second objective} is to track existing instances of graded type systems and to integrate them in our general framework. The {\bf third objective} is to select a fragment of the system for the purpose of implementation: this fragment need to be inferenceable up-to the use of some widening and calls over an SMT solver (to resolve algebraic constraints).

\section{Excellence}
\subsection{Quality, innovative aspects and credibility of the research\\  (including inter/multidisciplinary aspects)}

The SATIR project intends to specify a particular subclass of abstract interpretation that we call graded type systems. Another way to state it is that SATIR project intends to reinject the whole power of abstract interpretation inside a type system by substituting the choice of the domain by the choice of some more refine algebraic structures called grading structures.

\noindent{\bf Objective 1: Theory\ \ } Our main objective is to build up a comprehensive theory of graded types in its most general version. This objective can be split in three successive goals. {\bf Goal 1.1} consists in identifying the exact nature of grading structures. {\bf Goal 1.2} aims at transporting abstract interpretation principles to graded type systems. Finally, {\bf Goal 1.3} extends the result in several directions (generalisations to a full fledged language and to intersection type systems).

\noindent{\bf Objective 2: Applications\ \ } The second objective pursues real applications. Indeed, we intend to spend an important time looking for existing related work and possible applications. The intent behind this objective is both to get some inspiration for the general case and also to disseminate our results. There are three phases, or goals, regarding the applications. {\bf Goal 2.1} aims at studying and internalizes actual fully formed instances of graded type systems such as those of \BLL, \DlPCF or \DFuzz.\footnote{See paragraph ``State of the art''} {\bf Goal 2.2} focuses on qualitative examples and {\bf Goal 2.3} focuses on quantitative ones.

\noindent{\bf Objective 3: Implementation\ \ } The third objective is the delivery of an implementation for the end of the three years project. This line of work also takes into account the studies relative to the whole type inference process which form {\bf Goal 3.1}. The implementation itself is the {\bf Goal 3.2}, we are aiming for a simplified functional language where the user only provides the graded structure and heuristics for the widening. The objective also contains {\bf Goal 3.3} which is pure learning over later-phase and future complements such as the use of SMT-solvers.

\paragraph{Outgoing Host Institution}
The Department of Computer and Information Science of the University of Pennsylvania is part of the
school of School of Engineering and Applied Science and is one of the birthplace of the modern
computer. It was here that the ENIAC, the world's first electronic, large-scale, general-purpose
digital computer, was developed in 1946. Nowadays, the Department of Computer and
Information Science combines energies of professors, researchers and doctoral students resulting
from different research areas: Artificial Intelligence, Graphics, Information Management,
Software Principles, Systems, Theory. The faculty of the Department of Computer and
Information Science counts 78 members: 33 primary faculty, 19 secondary faculty, 5 lecturers, 16
adjunct faculty, 5 emeritus professors. Moreover, the Department of Computer and Information
Science counts more than 110 doctoral students.\todo{out-dated?}

Outside from the hosting group (Programming Language group), collaborations are expected with the ``Logic and Computation group'' (objective 1.1) and the ``Security and Privacy group'' (objectives 2.1 and 2.2) . Notice that these groups already share numeral active collaborations with the host group.\todo{Will I be part of Pen PL Club only?}


\paragraph{Outgoing Phase Group}
Among the different research groups, the Programming Language group (Penn \href{http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~plclub/}{PL club})
works on several specific topics in programming language theory and practice related to the
research topic of this project. In particular, it studies advanced type systems including subtyping,
object-oriented languages, ad hoc polymorphism, polytypic programming, and substructural type
systems; language design and implementation; language-based security; metaprogramming;
foundations for concurrent, distributed, and mobile computing. 

The PL club actually counts 3 professors and more than 10 doctoral students and post-doc researchers. \todo{out-dated?} The group stand as one of the worldwide top theoritical programing language groups with yearly publications in ACM POPL.


\paragraph{Outgoing Phase Supervisor}
\href{http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~stevez/}{Steve Zdancewic} is reconised as an international expert of functional programing languages and security. His research interests lie in theoretical computer science, programming language design and implementation (Coq verification of LLVM program transformations and randomized algorithms, type-directed program synthesis, linear types and GUI programming), langage enforcing verification (language-based enforcement of information-flow policies, low-level code memory safety, understanding dynamic security policies, and authorization logic) as well as secure concurrent and distributed computing, functional programming languages, type theory, linear and modal logics, theorem proving and mechanized metatheory.

\medskip

The project is divided in three parallel lines. The theory line focuses on developing the main theory behind our project. The Application line has for goal to understand related fields and to apply our result to those fields. The Implementation line is targeting an implementation of our language.

\paragraph{Theory:}
The main objective follows a sequential pattern.

Goal~1.1 is supposed to be the basis for all the remaining work, it is thus scheduled the first year. Notice, moreover, that no other research-focused work package has been planned in parallel (except for the three last months that are assumed to be in final phase). %drg: strange to allocate time for write-up this is not a phd thesis! %F: I change it to final phase: I just wanted to express that those WP will be less active at that time.
Goal~1.1 has three different work packages. Work package~1.1.1 is a package that focuses on grading non conventional models of linear logics in order to investigate natural extensions of graded type systems. It is a support package for packages~1.1.2 and~1.1.3, and no important direct result are expected here. Work package~1.1.2 has the objective to specify the notion of dependence over grading structures. Work package~1.1.3 has the objective to distinguish a set of independent and interacting layers in the grading structure such as the monad-comonad separation. Early results on these two directions are quite promising and several researchers are active in this area; thus expecting a reasonable formalisation before the two year deadline can be considered medium risk. 

Goal~1.2 is at the heart of this project and investigates the AI-related features of graded type systems. It is planned the second year, but is extended with preliminaries and some remaining work. Work package~1.2.1 is a learning-focused package that aims at expanding the knowledge of the applicant regarding abstract interpretation. %drg: you need a strong collaborator here! %F: true... that is one of the bad-point of the proposal. 
Work package~1.2.2 explores in more detail the order that naturally arises from grading structures in order to link it with domain theory. We expect this package to end with a notion of Galois relation between grading structures. Work package~1.2.3 is focusing on fixpoints, and in particular on the corresponding notion of widening. This package is considered low risk once the Galois connection has been properly set.

Goal~1.3 consists in optional extensions of the theoretical work. In particular, Work package~1.3.1 is aimed at extending the theory for a $\lambda$-calculus to a full fledged language and Work package~1.3.2 is investigating the extension to intersection types.



\paragraph{Applications:}
The applications line follows a classic 2-2-2 pattern corresponding to the three applicative objectives, each separated into a learning phase (9 mouths) and an active phase (duration varying with the difficulty level). Notice that this objective is composed only of collaborative material.

Goal~2.1 (work packages~2.1.1 and~2.2) targets the embedding of \BLL, \DlPCF and \DFuzz in our system. It is considered low risk as these languages are well established so that we roughly have to verify that we are taking into consideration each of its components. This objective is mainly aiming at supporting Goal~1.1 with real examples. Moreover, this goal has been scheduled just after one year spent in Focus team (Bologna) that created \DlPCF and in the UPen's programming language team that created \DFuzz.

Goal~2.2 (work packages~2.2.1 and~2.2.2) targets the embedding of qualitative examples such as the control flow analyzes and\footnote{the intersection-free fragment of} the higher order model checking. This objective is classed high risk for several reasons: this will be the first new application and the relation between graded type systems and higher order model checking is not yet fully established. Its scheduling at middle position among applicative goals permit to manage the high risk by potentially extending the deadline. Moreover, the parallelizing of Goal~2.2 and the work package 1.2.3 is important as the fixpoint construction is fundamental in higher order model checking application. Finally, its scheduling permit a potential additional investigation over intersection type systems at the end of the project.

Goal~2.3 (work packages~2.3.1 and~2.3.2) targets the embedding of quantitative examples such as probability or scheduling. This goal is classified medium risk despite their intrinsic difficulties since the applicant has some experience with these cases. Remark that this goal is planed in Birmingham with Dan Ghica that is an expert of the scheduling example (which we believe critical). 
%G: You will also work with Alex Smith who is an expert in hardware implementations, a possible application which you might mention. 
%F: Now in my todo list, thanks

  WP 3.3.2: optional learning
}


\paragraph{Milestones and deliverables:}

There are three main milestones at the end of every year and three secondary milestones around midyear.

The first secondary milestone (around month 9) does not have a deliverable but \todo{or col. with Steve over WP 1.1} it marks the end of the adjustment and warm-up period. In particular, WP 2.1 and WP 3.1 will switch from learning phase to active file while WP 1.1 will go to a writing phase. The end of this writing phase is marked by the {\bf Milestone 1} with 2 deliverable articles corresponding to WP 1.1.2 and 1.1.3; at least one of these article should be a collaboration with the host team, corresponding with the ongoing WP 2.1.2.

The second secondary milestone (from month 16 to month 18) is a smooth transition with an collaborative article as delivery focused on Objective 2.1 and with early results of WP 3.1.2. {\bf Milestone 2} corresponds to the delivery of two articles. The first is a collaborative article treating WP 1.2.2 and the first advancements over WP 2.2.2. The second is a single-authored article over WP 3.1.2.

The last secondary milestone (from month 27 to month 29) is an other fuzzy transition with a collaborative article as delivery around work packages 1.2.3 and 2.2.2; this milestone will also mark the point where an engineer will be hired to work on the implementation.\todo{to discuss}  {\bf Milestone 3} marks the end of the project with the full implementation of WP 3.2 as delivery as well as a collaborative article over WP 2.3.2 together with results from WP 1.3.1.
