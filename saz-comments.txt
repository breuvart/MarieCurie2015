* If the audience is broader than just computer scientists, I would
  add a bit of general motivation about the need for improved software
  verification.  

  - software is becoming increasingly critical (autonomous vehicles, Internet, etc.)
  - bugs and security vulnerabilities are costly
  - type systems are a scalable way to analyze software
  - "graded type systems" will improve the state-of-the-art by including more information in the types


F: I will add this for sure (the technical evaluation is performed by a 
   specialist, but the final decision is taken by a non-specialist assembly


* I like the idea of using contraints drawn from an algebraic structure.  This seems like doing some kind of "symbolic" abstract interpretation.

* You should be sure to include a description of how you intend to evaluate the results of your work.  I would suggest:

  - metatheory:  proving that the graded type system is sound w.r.t some semantics
  - expressiveness: pick a good goal example program and property that you'd like to be able to typecheck with the system

* Related to the above: You should include (as much as possible) a
  concrete example of the informativeness of a graded type (and
  perhaps compare it to a standard type for the same program).

F: You are write, I was actually planing to add several concrete objectives depending of the remaining space.
   As for the metatheory, I just forgot to add it, of course it is a must-have (especially since I have
   specialized in denotational models until now). 


* You should (probably briefly, depending on space) compare against potential related work.  You touch on dependently typed languages, but there are other kinds of refinment types, etc.

F: I do admit that I felt my knowlege to be a bit lacking regarding other kind of type systems 
   (except for intersection types and subtyping that I will extend in the state-of-the-art section). 
   If you feel the need to add it, I will do a bit of bibliography.


* There are numerous English errors that I'm happy to help correct in a future pass through the proposal.

F: Thank you verry much. My english is, indeed, still lacking in numerous aspects...
